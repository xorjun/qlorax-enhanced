#### **Issue 2: Port Already in Use**
```
Error: [Errno 10048] Address already in use: ('127.0.0.1', 7860)
```
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check what's using the port
netstat -ano | findstr :7860
# Use alternative port
python scripts/gradio_app.py --server-port 7861
```

#### **Issue 3: Out of Memory During Training**
```
Error: RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory
```
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Edit config to reduce batch size
# In configs/instructlab-config.yaml:
# batch_size: 2  # Reduce from 4
# gradient_accumulation_steps: 8  # Increase to maintain effective batch size
```
