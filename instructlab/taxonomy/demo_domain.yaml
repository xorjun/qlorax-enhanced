seed_examples:
- question: What is machine learning?
  answer: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers
    to learn from data without explicit programming.
- question: Explain QLoRA fine-tuning
  answer: QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) is an efficient fine-tuning method
    that uses 4-bit quantization and low-rank adapters to reduce memory usage while
    maintaining performance.
- question: How does parameter-efficient fine-tuning work?
  answer: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA only update a small subset
    of model parameters, making fine-tuning faster and more memory-efficient while
    preserving model capabilities.
